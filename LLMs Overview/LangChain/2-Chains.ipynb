As the temperature increases, the peak intensity of the radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths, resulting in a change in color from red to orange, yellow, white, and eventually blue at very high temperatures.\\n\\nBlack body radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and has various applications, including understanding the behavior of stars, explaining the cosmic microwave background radiation, and developing technologies like incandescent light bulbs and thermal imaging devices.'"
